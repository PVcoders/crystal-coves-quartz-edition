let descs = {
    "stone": "Stone is an extremely general term for rock. Most stone in video games most closely matches bedrock.",
    "voidElement": "Wat",
    "copper": "Copper is a common mineral that is often used for wires due to its conductiveness. Silver is actually more conductive than copper, but copper is used because it is cheaper.",
    "coal": "Coal is made up of dead plants \"metamorphasized\" by rocks piling on top of it and causing pressure. It is being used quicker than you think; with the current rate of extraction, we will be out of coal in 435 years.",
    "quartz": "Quartz is a common yet useful mineral often found in tech like computers and modern clocks. It has just a few variants like citrine, amethyst, tiger's eye, agate, smoky quartz, rose quartz, aventurine, jasper, onyx, blue quartz, ametrine, quartz, prasiolite, rutilated quartz, clear quartz, mtorolite, chalcedony, carnelian, milky quartz, onyx, jasper, carnelian, chrysoprase, and heliotrope.",
    "iron": "Iron is often extracted in various different ores, but most commonly hematite. Hematite is the same thing as iron rust. Hematite can be found on entirely different planets and even gives Mars its color! Not all hematite is brown.",
    "lead": "Lead was used in plumbing systems until it was found out that it was poisonous. Then it was used in pencils until graphite was developed. Then it was used in gasoline, but it was banned in 1975. It still is used today in ammunition, car batteries, and many other things, but is still a deadly neurotoxin.",
    "basalt": "Basalt is the most common rock in the ocean floor. However, it appears more infrequently on the surface. Basaltic magmas has 45-55% silica and lots of iron, magnesium, and calcium. Some basalt can form air bubbles and become vesicular basalt.",
    "tungsten": "Tungsten is an extremely resistant metal. It has the highest melting point of any metal at a whopping 3,422 degrees C and a boiling point of 5,555 degrees C, which is higher than the heat of the Sun's surface.",
    "amethyst": "Amethyst is a variant of quartz! Amethyst is not considered precious nor normal, but it is considered \"semiprecious\" and is not ridiculously expensive nor dirt cheap. Amethyst seems more expensive than it is because it is often combined with more expensive minerals in jewlery. ",
    "gold": "Gold is a precious metal that is the only naturally yellow metal. Gold is one of the densest minerals, only competing with tungsten with its specific gravity being 19.3 alongside with tungsten. However, it is highly malleable and can be flattened into an extremely thin sheet to be used as a rich person's walls.",
    "relic": "This relic is made of bronze and is likely too large to be used as an actual cup considering the other ores. It may have been used during a ceremonial ritual due to the size and was also likely highly valued because it was perserved. The relic may or may not have looked different due to the bronze chips surrounding it.",
    "emerald": "Emeralds are a variant of the mineral beryl, colored green by trace amounts of chromium/vanadium. The first emerals were mined in Egypt in around 1500 BC. Not all emeralds are the iconic green color and some are more teal.",
    "diamond": "Diamonds are found naturally inside kimberlite tubes, large cylinders composed of a rock called kimberlite. They can also be lab grown by either exposing a thin sheet of diamond to lots of carbon (CVD) or applying extreme pressure and heat to pure carbon (HPHT). Suprisingly, lab grown diamonds range around the same price per carat as natural ones.",
    "fossil": "Fossils have NEVER been found fully complete. The fossil in the image appears to be a fish, but this is a complete image of a fish and is unlikely. It may be a scaled dinosaur. Only if we knew how big the blocks were.",
    "painite": "Painite is an extremely rare mineral due to the mixture of zirconium and boron usually not coming togheter in nature. The first painite was discovered as recently as in the 1950s and was mistaken for a ruby. Only two more were found until 2001.",
    "citrine": "Citrine is a variant of quartz! Citrine can be found in nature, but it is very rare due to the conditions needed to form it. The most common way for citrine to be made is to heat an amethyst.",
    "rosequartz": "Rose quartz is an iconic pretty pink color due to tiny pink fibers inside the quartz named dididumortierite (say that 3 times fast). Before then, it was thought that rose quartz was pink because of titanium, maganese, and iron until a study in the late 90s discovered the fibers.",
    "smokyquartz": "Smoky quartz can range in a wide variety of colors, with darker samples tending to be more expensive. Natural radiation is the cause of the brown color, reacting with the trace aluminium in the stone. The darker the crystal is, the more radiation it has had and therefore the older. This process can be reversed using heat.",
    "chalcedony": "Chalcedony is a variant of quartz! Chalcedony can appear in an extremely wide range of colors, with the most common ones being white, blue, and yellow/brown. Chalcedony can be semitransparent. It is cryptocrystalline, meaning that the crystal patterns can only be seen under a microscope.",
    "tigerseye": "Tiger's eye is a variant of quartz! Tiger's eye is not the only gemstone with eye in its name. There is also an ox's eye and hawk's eye. Hawk's eye is known more scientifically as crocidolite or blue asbestos. I could not find information on ox's eye other than it forms by heating tiger's eye."
